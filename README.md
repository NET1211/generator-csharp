# API Client Generator for C#

A generator for protocol buffer described APIs for and in C#.

[![Travis build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/googleapis/gapic-generator-csharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/googleapis/gapic-generator-csharp)

This is a generator for API client libraries for APIs specified by protocol buffers, such as those inside Google.
It takes a protocol buffer (with particular annotations) and uses it to generate a client library.

## Purpose

We aim for this generator to replace the [older monolithic generator](https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator).

Disclaimer
----------
This generator is currently experimental. Please don't use it for anything mission-critical.
